\title{Calculate pvclust() tree (a binary tree of distances between end-clusters) for ARBOL results
default method creates a tree based on euclidean distance between cluster centroids based on gene medians with complete linkage}
\usage{
centroidTaxonomy(
  srobj,
  tree_reduction = "centroids",
  hclust_method = "complete",
  distance_method = "euclidean",
  centroid_method = "mean",
  centroid_layer = "scale.data",
  centroid_assay = "SCT",
  reduction_dims = 1:25,
  gene_list = Features(srobj),
  nboot = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{srobj}{a seurat object with ARBOL 'tierNident' column}

\item{tree_reduction}{either 'centroids', which calculates centroids among all genes, or any reduction layer in srobj}

\item{hclust_method}{any hierarchical clustering method implemented in pvclust::pvclust(method.hclust), defaults to 'complete'}

\item{distance_method}{any distance method implemented in pvclust::pvclust(method.dist) - one of "correlation", "abscor", "uncentered", "euclidean" -
or cosine (no quotes) as implemented in ARBOL::cosine. you may also write your own function that returns a dist object, as in pvclust::pvclust()}

\item{centroid_method}{the function used to calculate centroids in the tree_reduction matrix, as implemented in Matrix.utils::aggregate.Matrix(fun)
currently, sum, count, mean, and median are supported}

\item{centroid_assay}{if using cell x gene data (not any srobj@reduction), the assay within which to calculate centroids}

\item{reduction_dims}{the dimensions of the reduction layer to use for centroid calculation. defaults to 1:25}

\item{gene_list}{if using cell x gene data (not any srobj@reduction), genes to include in centroid calculation. passes to getCentroids}
}
\value{
the input seurat object with pvclust tree in srobj@misc$pvclust
}
